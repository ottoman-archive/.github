## Who am I?

My name is Colin Greenstreet. I am a research public historian, convenor of the [ai + history collaboratory](https://github.com/Addaci/ai-and-history-collaboratory/), and founder of [MarineLives](http://www.marinelives.org/wiki/MarineLives).

I write a Substack called [Generative Lives](https://generativelives.substack.com/), and have published a series of articles about the application of large language models to machine transcription of printed documents and manuscripts.

## Opening the Ottoman Archive

My most recent Substack article looks at the a number of the languages of the Ottoman Empire - Ottoman Turkish, Albanian, Bulgarian, Greek, and Armenian - as well as modern Turkish.

`Greenstreet, Colin, 'Opening the Ottoman Archive: You want to do granular research on the Ottoman Empire and its successor states, but don't read Ottoman Turkish. Do you throw up you hands or look for a new set of powerful tools?', Generative Lives, January 4th 2026.` Click [here](https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive)
