## Who am I?

My name is Colin Greenstreet. I am a research public historian, convenor of the ai + history collaboratory, and founder of MarineLives.

I write a Substack called Generative Lives, and have published a series of articles about the application of large language models to machine transcription of printed documents and manuscripts.

## Opening the Ottoman Archive

My most recent Substack article looks at the a number of the languages of the Ottoman Empire - Ottoman Turkish, Albanian, Bulgrian, Greek, and Armenian - as well as modern Turkish.

`Greenstreet, Colin, 'Opening the Ottoman Archive: You want to do granular research on the Ottoman Empire and its successor states, but don't read Ottoman Turkish. Do you throw up you hands or look for a new set of powerful tools?', Generative Lives, January 4th 2026.` Click [here](https://generativelives.substack.com/p/opening-the-ottoman-archive)

## The ottoman-archive GitHUb organisation

The ottoman-archive GitHub organisation is a platform on which to develop the ideas contained in the Substack article with like  minded historians - both Ottoman history and language specialists and general historians.
